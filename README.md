# tripSplit


Sometimes you might borrow a â‚¹20 note from a friend, but more often than not you might forget to return it. Imagine this, you go out with all your friends and don't know how to divide the total among all of you? This is a common problem when it comes to parties and trips as well. So wouldn't it be great if you could settle these small transactions in some way or the other? Or We could have intelligent bill splitting among the group of people based on their previous shares.

Here is an app to take care of such stuff for you. 

#Introducing pySplit 

The app to free you from all the hassle and settle these small transactions in a more sophisticated manner.

So how do we do it?
We fetch all the people from your contact list who have tripSplit installed on their devices or maybe not ;). You can form groups when going out for a party, trip etc. and can scan your bills, and to divide among all your peers.

More importantly, you can settle transactions directly from within the app using PayPal.

We use Realtime Image Processing to track the shares of each friend and build a Leaderboards from them. You can check who is your most miser friend ;).
